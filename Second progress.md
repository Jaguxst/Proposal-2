# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mortal Pong

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
The game like a regular game of single player ping-pong game that has a twist without telling the player the twist. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software that I'm using is the Love2d. It will help me be able to make the game. Some features will have a death ball that when the player hits the player paddle it will stop the game. When the player gets a certain amount of point it will spawn a more death ball. Some might be real and some might not be real. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome is that I havae a game wroking without no errors. What I mean by this is that the ball can bounce off the paddle easy without no porblems. 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The BETTER outcome is that the ball can bounce off and the death ball work as it was intended for and I might add another ball to the mix to make it more challenging.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

THe BEST outcome is that is I have a working game with all the faeature that I want to add to the game. I hope that it can come out the the way I planned it to be. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would need to learn a whole new lanague to code for my game. I would watch youtube video for the best research to help because I'm learning while do the project. With the new information I have I will be able to to make my game with any problem but if I face and any obstalces I will be able to to find a soultion if I can.
